# Hey there! Welcome to my Github

I'm Luis, a Backend Developer focused in **.NET** technologies, among which are **C#, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, MVC pattern, Identity, LINQ, Azure, SQL Server, Dapper, Angular**, among others, and with which I develop my own projects such as **Web Applications, API's, Databases, User and Security Systems**, etc.

I always seek to constantly improve and think beyond to propose new ideas, although I am aware that, to create innovative things, you first have to know what has been done previously. Besides, I am always updating my knowledge and learning new things, as I consider that in the ever-changing technology industry you can be left behind if you get a little distracted.
